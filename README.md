# Customers Segmentation 

At its most basic, customers segmentation is the division of potential customers in a given market into many different groups. That division is based on customers wants and needs and their purchasing characteristics. 

There are many benefits of doing customers segmentation. The company can understand their customers better, then they can be able to send marketing messages to the right customer at the right time in the right place. Another benefit is that the company can use their marketing cost more effectively by understand their customer behavior.

In this project, we use the customers data base from a superstore which includes 50,000 customer rows and 24 variables. We do the project following steps:

1. Visualizing data by using Tableau

2. Cleaning and manipulating data by using “dplyr” package in R

3. Using RFM model to divide customers into 4 customer groups: leaved, leaving, good and new customers

4. Applied k-means clustering into each group of customers to understand their purchasing behavior

5. Visualize the results
